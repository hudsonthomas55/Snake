# Snake
A throwback game of Snake

This game used to be on the old Nokia phones and was one of the most-played games of that time period. Essentially, the goal is to eat as many food bits are you can without hitting a wall or yourself. The trick is, the snake gets longer with each bite of food. 

Good luck!
